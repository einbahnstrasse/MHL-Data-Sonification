## Week 6 Asyncronous Assignments 
### Deadline: Friday, November 8, 2024.   

For these tasks below (1 and 2), record your personal reflections and send them to me by **Friday, November 8**. You can **write them down**, or you can submit a **video or audio recording** as I will describe below:  

### 1. Explore the Data Sonification Archive          

Check out the [**Data Sonification Archive**](https://sonification.design/){:target="_blank"}, which you can also find linked on our [Software + Resources Page](https://einbahnstrasse.github.io/MHL-Data-Sonification/resources/#data-sonification-archive){:target="_blank"}. This project is curated by Sara Lenzi and Paolo Ciuccarelli with the assistance of Nicole Zizzi, Yuan Hua, and Houjiang Liu — scholars at the Center for Design at Northeastern University, the Critical Alarms Lab, TU Delft, and the University of Texas—Austin: 

> *“This curated collection is part of a broader research endeavor in which data, sonification and design converge to explore the potential of sound in complementing other modes of representation and broadening the publics of data. With visualization still being one of the prominent forms of data transformation, we believe that sound can both enrich the experience of data and build new publics.”*  

Your tasks: 

1. Have a look at — and a listen to — the various projects in the archive. 
2. Identify 2 projects in the archive: one that you like, and one that you don't like, or don't like _as much_, or one that you are more critical of. 
3. Write down your reflections on each of these (or make a recording, as described below). Devote about one paragraph of your thoughts to each of your choices; at least a few sentences each, detailing what you think are their specific strengths and weaknesses, and their alignment (or disalignment!) with your aesthetic or artistic orientation. 
4. You can write or record more than 2 paragraphs as needed, but at a very minimum, one paragraph each is suitable to make your position clear for each piece. 
5. You can also choose more than 2 pieces if you prefer, but don't let these "extras" get in the way of the tasks below.  

### 2. Initial Thoughts on Your Project            

After considering the archive, and after the first 4 weeks of technical skill building (elementary data structures, spreadsheets, coding basics), start to think about your own project for this class. 

Write down or record a short summary of your thinking up to this point. Answer the folloiwng questions:   

1. Did you have an initial project idea before we began our seminar?  
2. How have our materials potentially changed your thinking about the use of data in music?  
3. You don't need to have a fully-formed project proposal yet, but if you had to make a decision today, what would your project proposal look like? 
4. How might you use real-world or generated data to make a notated concert piece, an installation work, an improvisational environment, or another expressive and artistic form?  
5. Have our course materials given you any new ideas about how you might use data in your work?   
6. What would you like to accomplish this semester in terms of building your data analysis or sonification skills?  
7. What are your thoughts on the following statement:

> “Sonification pieces should strive to make relationships in the data intelligible in the sound.”   
    - Is this necessary to make a successful piece?
    - What are some strategies you can envision that work within and outside of an intelligibility requirement?   

8. Do your reactions to the Sonification Archive (above) inform your aesthetic direction? Are there things you want to avoid or pursue that you picked up from the pieces you heard there?     

You might need more room to answer these questions, so be prepared to submit about 3-5 paragraphs worth of your thoughts, or however you much you think is necessary.   
   
### Video/Audio Recording, Rather Than Writing  

You're busy, I get it. Aren't we all?  

You have the option to simply speak about your thoughts on these questions and submit a recording of yourself, taken with your cell phone (like the cable coiling assignment ages ago), or you can use some very powerful **speech-to-text features** to do the typing for you. Here, I demonstrate how this can be done in **Google Docs** or the **Gmail mobile app**:
